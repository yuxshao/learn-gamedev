## About This Document
### Methodology
This guide will guide you through making two simple games. One will be a top-down shooter style game that will help you become familiar with the GameMaker program that we will be using and with the concept of a MVP (minimum viable product). Afterwards, you will be guided on making a more complex platformer-style game, building upon what we have learned previously.

### Prerequisites
Installing the GameMaker program. No prior coding knowledge is required.

### The End Product
2 games, one a simple top-down shooter, another being a more complex platformer.
