## About This Document
### Methodology
This guide will guide you through making two simple games. One will be a top-down shooter style game that will help you become familiar with the GameMaker program that we will be using and with the concept of a MVP (minimum viable product). Afterwards, you will be guided on making a more complex platformer-style game, building upon what we have learned previously.

### Prerequisites
Installing the GameMaker program. No prior coding knowledge is required.

### The End Product
2 games, one a simple top-down shooter, another being a more complex platformer.

You can find sample code on [GitHub][github]

## 1.1 Game Design Considerations

<a id="What-makes-a-good-game"></a>

### 1.1.1 What makes a good game?

If you're interested in making a game, you must have played a few games here and there. As you know, there isn't a definitive definition of what a "good" game is. A game that you think is amazing might be so-so to your friend, and vice versa. However, there are certain points of games that make them stand out from the crowd. Generally, good games give the player enough freedom to do as they please, but still give a set of rules that the player must follow. The set of rules is what we can call the mechanic of the game, which will be expanded upon later.

<a id="Things-to-focus-on"></a>
### 1.1.2 Things to Focus on

When building your game, there are a few points to consider before tackling your project. First and foremost, the game you make, either on your own or with a group, should be something that is managable, in both complexity and size. Another point to think about is the engine that you will be using when developing your game. Various engines come with different capabilities, which will influence what your game will be like. 

When planning out your project, it is important to give yourself guidelines of when you want certain parts of the game to be in a completed state. By giving yourself a calendar to work with will allow you and your group to be more organized when creating your project.

Finally, when planning out your game, make sure it is something that you would enjoy playing, as well as developing!

### 1.1.3 How we Develop Games

There are many ways to develop games, however, in this lesson we will be focused on developing a game centered around a mechanic.

## 1.2 Game Programming

Steven's stuff goes here

## 1.3 Minimum Viable Product

<a id="bare-bones"></a>
### 1.3.1 What is a Minimum Viable Product?

A Minimum Viable Product (henceforth 'MVP') is a bare bones version of your game. This is a stage where there will be no art or music in your game and usually the game will consist of one level or room of your game.


<a id="uses-MVP"></a>
### 1.3.2 Uses of the MVP

This is used mainly in testing purposes to see if your mechanic works as intended. By having an MVP, you can work out any bugs, allow others to test your game's mechanic, and start tweaking things to your liking.


<a href="#top" class="top" id="tools-used">Top</a>
## 1.4 Tools used in the Gaming Industry

The Game Development industry uses a plethora of tools when developing games. From the small indie studios to the large triple-A productions, these tool are used in the creation of all sorts of games.

<a id="list-engines"></a>
### 1.4.1 List of game engines

Here's a list of some of the game engines that are used:

Unity
Unreal Engine
GameMaker
RPG Maker
Twine

<a id="list-tools"></a>
### 1.4.2 List of various other tools

These might come in handy later on when creating assets, music, and other parts of your game.

Autodesk Maya 
Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, etc.
Audacity (free music editor)

### 2.1 Parts of GameMaker

In GameMaker, a game is made up of various parts. Here we'll describe each part and their function before we move on to using them when making our basic game.

Sprite: Graphic used to represent the object. This is what the player will see.

Object: An object in GameMaker consists of events, and sometimes a sprite to represent that object. Objects can be solid or transparent to suit your needs.

Room: This is where all of parts of your game will be. Essentially, a room is where your game will take place.

Background: This will be displayed as the background of the room. 

Sound: Sound effects and background music. By using events on an object you can make the set the sound to go off depending on the situation.

Path: By drawing a path in a room, you can set it so that an object will follow a specific path.

Timeline: Using the steps in the game, you can set it so that specific events occur at a specified time.

This game we just finished making can be seen as a completed MVP. As an MVP should be, the game is pretty bare bones, with no fancy sprites, sound effects, or visuals. This is purely testing out the mechanic of our game, and seeing if the mechanic runs as we want it to in-game. From here on out with this game you can add nice visuals and music, as well as add addition content such as new levels, power-ups,and the like. From here, the sky's the limit! Now that we have that simple top-down shooter in our arsenal of game making, let's move on to something that's a little more challenging to create, the iconic platformer.

##4a Finite State Machines

<a id="another-subsection"></a>
### 4.1.1 What are they?

A finite state machine is an abstract model that can represent a program. In the machine are states, and at certain states the machine will perform a different action based on the input it receieves. Based on the input, the machine can move to another state, where it will follow a different set of rules than the previous one. (Taking the class Computer Science Theory will let you get more in-depth with FSM, along with other models of computation!)

<a id="another-subsection"></a>
###4b Application in games?

In a way, a game is a very elaborate computer program, and as such the idea of a FSM can come in handy when planning out your game. The states in an FSM can be seen as different scenarios in your game, and in different scenarios, ideally different things should happen. Thinking of the player's choices as inputs, at different scenarios you would want the game to make choices based on those inputs. 

<a id="another-subsection"></a>
###4c How does GM's rooms give this functionality?

The rooms in GameMaker can be seen as a state. The player will give the inputs, and depending on what room that the game is currently on will determine the outcome of those inputs. A room in GM have specific properties that will determine the outcome of a player's actions. For example, in a room with heavier gravity than the previous room will cause the player's jump height to be lower. Moving between rooms can also be seen as moving between states. Many things, like score, lives, and the like can determine which room will be the next room that the player will go to.

##5c: Design considerations: What will make your game stand out from the crowd?

Congratulations! You made it to the end of this lesson! Now that you have made two games, and have gotten a feel for game design, why don't you start embellishing these games to make them truly stand out? We don't go step by step for these suggestions, but we'll give helpful hints to guide you.

Now, here are some gimmicks you can try to add into your game!

Power-up items: Remember how we added coins in our platformer? Adding items is probably the next thing that came into your mind. Adding an item is very similar to adding a coin into your platformer, and the effect they have can be determined by you! Just like how we wrote how to make the coin counter go up as you collected more coins, you can code in specific effects, like the player getting larger or becoming invinsible, as well.

Gaining extra lives based on some value: Have you played Super Mario Bros.? If you have, you would probably know that collecting 100 coins nets you an extra life. Why don't you try adding that in to your game? But, it doesn't have to necessariliy be the number of coins. Why not have it so that for every 1000 points in your score you get an extra life? Try to get creative here! And why an extra life? Why not make it that the player becomes invincible? Or super big? Or anything really that you can come up with!

Special platforms/spaces: Now that you know that everything in a room in GameMaker is an object, why not play with that idea and try to make special platforms or spaces? How about a space that makes the player super fast for a few seconds? Or maybe a spring to let them jump higher? By making special space objects and adding events to either the player or the space itself to give these effects can help make your platformer more dynamic and open up new revenues for in-game puzzles and more creative level designs!


The possibilities are endless when designing a game. This is a world you're creating, so don't be afraid to experiment when making it!
